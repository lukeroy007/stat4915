## 🎬 Welcome

### Unsupervised Learning: A Data Science Lens  
**Luke Roy**  
**STAT 4915 Capstone Presentation**

---

## 🧠 What is Unsupervised Learning?

- No labeled outcomes
- Goal: discover hidden structure in data
- Contrast with supervised learning
- Common categories:
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality Reduction
  - Anomaly Detection

---

## 📦 Why Does This Matter?

- Many real-world datasets have no labels
- Enables **exploratory analysis**, **segmentation**, **feature learning**
- Widely used in:
  - NLP (e.g., topic modeling)
  - Finance (e.g., fraud detection)
  - Biology (e.g., gene expression patterns)

---

## 🧰 Clustering Methods

### Common approaches:
- **K-Means**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **DBSCAN**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**

💡 Use case: Segmenting customers, market analysis

---

## 📉 Dimensionality Reduction

### Common methods:
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **t-SNE**
- **UMAP**

Used for:
- Visualization of high-dimensional data
- Noise reduction
- Feature extraction

---

## 🧪 How Do We Evaluate Unsupervised Models?

- No ground truth = no accuracy score
- Strategies:
  - **Silhouette score** (clustering)
  - **Davies–Bouldin index**
  - **Reconstruction error** (autoencoders)
  - **Visual inspection** (plots like t-SNE)
  - **Stability/consistency checks**
  - **Domain knowledge**

---

## 🔬 Benchmarking Approaches

- Use synthetic datasets (e.g., `make_blobs`)
- Compare algorithm performance:
  - Runtime
  - Interpretability
  - Scalability
- Try multiple techniques on same data

---

## 🧭 Connecting to Research Projects

You could use unsupervised learning to:

- **Cluster firms** based on financial statements
- **Detect anomalies** in SEC filings
- **Reduce dimensions** in time series data

(But this talk is *not* about your final project — it's setting the stage!)

---

## 🔍 Real-World Example: NYT Word Embeddings

- t-SNE on New York Times articles
- Shows how articles with similar topics cluster
- Unlabeled → labeled using cluster insights

---

## 🤔 Common Pitfalls

- Overinterpreting noisy clusters
- Using clustering when not appropriate
- Forgetting to scale your data!
- Assuming structure where none exists

---

## 💬 Questions?

- What part of this was surprising?
- Which method do you want to try first?
- How might this connect to your project?
